## Overview

This thesis investigates facial emotion recognition using deep learning methods implemented in MATLAB. The work focuses on utilizing transfer learning with pretrained CNN models and LSTM networks to classify emotional states from facial expressions in image sequences. The Oulu-CASIA dataset, known for its high-quality video sequences under controlled lighting conditions, is used to train and evaluate the models.
